Require:
	Python= 3.6
	TensorFlow =1.4.1
	
	Running for Results:
		1.Run python remove_words.py mr
		2.Run python build_graph.py mr
		3.Run python train.py mr
		4.Change mr in above 3 commands with other datasets like R8,R52.
		
We were able to achieve the desired testing accuracy as the paper was stating during our training process on following dataset.
i.e. for mr dataset : 0.76084
	for r52 dataset: 0.93731
	for 20ng dataset: 0.86352
	for r8 dataset:0.97031
	
Now, Improvisation is done for mr dataset only.
		python train_mr.py
After improvisation we were able to achieve testing accuracy of 0.78500.
